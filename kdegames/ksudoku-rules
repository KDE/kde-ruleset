# KSudoku is a relatively new application, so run svn2git with the following option:

# These rules are 100% copied from killbots-rules, so if you find a mistake here,
# please also fix it there.

# Create the ksudoku repository
create repository ksudoku
end repository

# Set the REPO and MODULE variables, used by some included rules
declare REPO=ksudoku
declare MODULE=kdegames/ksudoku

# Ignore some things that are known to cause trouble
include ../common-kde-ignores

# In r641165, docs are moved from ksudoku/doc to doc/ksudoku,
# in r641166 the now-empty ksudoku/doc dir is deleted.
# This deletion makes svn2git delete the doc dir with its contents,
# so we have to ignore it here.
