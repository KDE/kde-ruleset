# In 1056605, a massive refactoring of KBlocks
# was committed into a branch, without any copy information.
# The refactoring itself was made outside version control.
#
# r1043346 is what I *think* was the base revision
# for the refactoring, based on .desktop changes.
# It should be accurate enough, since all nearby commits
# are .desktop changes from scripty.
