# Kannasaver was imported to the KDE SVN with r1036191
# so svn2git can be run with --resume-from option

# Kannasaver was never branched or tagged, so this is
# straight-forward.

# Create the kannasaver repository
create repository kannasaver
end repository

# Kannasaver from playground
match /trunk/playground/artwork/kannasaver/
  repository kannasaver
  branch master
end match

# Ignore the rest
match /
end match
