# exchange history in KDE SVN starts with r1265033
# so svn2git can be run with --resume-from option

# exchange was never branched or tagged, so this is
# straight-forward.

# Create the exchange repository
create repository exchange
end repository

# exchange from playground
match /trunk/playground/pim/akonadi/exchange/
  repository exchange
  branch master
end match

# Ignore the rest
match /
end match
