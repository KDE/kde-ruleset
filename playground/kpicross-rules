# KPicross was imported to the KDE SVN with r309898
# so svn2git can be run with --resume-from option

# KPicross was never branched or tagged, so this is
# straight-forward.

# Create the kpicross repository
create repository kpicross
end repository

# Kannasaver from playground
match /trunk/playground/games/kpicross/
  repository kpicross
  branch master
end match

# Ignore the rest
match /
end match
