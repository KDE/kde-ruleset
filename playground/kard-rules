# Kard history in KDE SVN starts with r497540
# so svn2git can be run with --resume-from option

# Kard was never branched or tagged, so this is
# straight-forward.

# Create the kard repository
create repository kard
end repository

# Kard from playground
match /trunk/playground/edu/kard/
  repository kard
  branch master
end match

# Ignore the rest
match /
end match
