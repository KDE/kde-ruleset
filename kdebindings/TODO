General:
 - It may be possible and a good idea to extract common rules into a single
   file that gets included from the language-specific rulefiles.


Ruby:
 - Follow past history of krossruby, when it was in koffice/libs/kross
   (moved in r646836).
 - Convert the "modular smoke branch" (merged in r807397).

Python:
 - Follow past history of krosspython, when it was in koffice/libs/kross
   (moved in r646837), and earlier in kexi.

Perl:
 - There seems to be a situation similar to Ruby, where something got copied
   from A to B, and A was deleted some revisions later, instead of using a
   proper svn mv. Revisions 1091178, 1091179, 1091180. [FIXED with a
   filter-branch script]
 - Something is fishy in r1129337. An entire directory got deleted. pumphaus
   doesn't know why, told me to ask burel.

C#:
 - Follow past history from playground/bindings/kimono (moved in 653084).
 - Convert the "modular smoke branch" (merged in r807397).
   -> note there is a backport in r781383
