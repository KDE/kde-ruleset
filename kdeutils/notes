filelight
=========

It's as complete as it can be.
Due to how late it went into KDE trunk,
it doesn't have any "global work branch".

The only missing thing is a 1.1 branch
under /branches/filelight/1.1,
which only has 1 commit that didn't get merged.
Probably a dead-end experiment.

ark

Looks pretty complete.
I didn't do an exhausive search for work branches yet
('ark' is a terrible search term).
