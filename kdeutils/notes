filelight
=========

It's as complete as it can be.
Due to how late it went into KDE trunk,
it doesn't have any "global work branch".

The only missing thing is a 1.1 branch
under /branches/filelight/1.1,
which only has 1 commit that didn't get merged.
Probably a dead-end experiment.

ark
===

Looks pretty complete.
I didn't do an exhausive search for work branches yet
('ark' is a terrible search term).

kcalc
=====

Comprehensively checked; there's nothing missing.

kcharselect
===========

Comprehensively checked; there's nothing missing.

kwallet
=======

Comprehensively checked; there's nothing missing.

sweeper
=======

Comprehensively checked.

Missing some $branch/kdebase/kcontrol/privacy/ history,
including suse_kickoff and suse_kickoff_qstyle work branches.

kgpg
====

Comprehensively checked, only thing missing was bleedingedge branch.

Merges synthed.

printer-applet
==============

There's nothing here outside trunk and version branches,
so even feature-branches is unnecessary.

kdf
===

Some doc history was missing, fixed now.
Note the fix requires a newer svn2git.

Work branches exported.
Comprehensive check didn't show anything else missing.

ktimer
======

Work branches added, merges synth'd,
but I didn't do a complete search for missing history yet.

kfloppy
=======

Work branches added. Nothing else is missing (checked w/ residual).

superkaramba
============

Work branches added, doc problems fixed.

User docs now appear in 'userdoc',
and the existing 'doc' directory
(containing API docs) is left in 'doc'.
A filter-branch script could rename both, though.

History was checked with residual repo,
only thing missing is the branches/work/sk4/superkaramba branch,
which is irrelevant (no useful changes, not merged back to trunk).

kremotecontrol
==============

Documentation messy here too.
In r1075787, trunk kdelirc branches into work/kdelirc;
this is converted to git including the 'doc' directory
which is in a separate place in SVN.
In r1100454, a 'doc' directory was added to the work branch.
Now that 'doc' directory has stuff mixed from both places.

To fix it, I added a filter-branch script that deletes the docs
from the correct commit range.

No history seems to be missing.
