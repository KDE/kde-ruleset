- for the record: r196843 adds documentation saying "moving documentation", but it doesn't actually exist anywhere else in SVN (it's not a move), so it's fine. I guess this is missing CVS history.
- should synth merge of make_kdeedu_cool to trunk (217425 -> 217432) [done-ish]

marble: [last checked Mar 1 23:28]
- synth merge of marble-geodata-nt to trunk (946595 -> 946666) [done-ish]

kstars:
- there were some deletions and re-additions of the entire trunk,
  should handle sanely in git.
- synth merge of make_kdeedu_cool to trunk (190438 -> 191485)

- check for other cases where parent-synthing is necessary

libkdeedu: [last checked Mar 10 02:45]
- convert kdeedu_parley branch [done]
- libkdeedu is mostly stuff extracted from other kdeedu apps; we
  should convert the past history from when it was in the app too.
   - /trunk/KDE/kdeedu/kanagram/src/fontutils
   - /branches/work/soc-parley/libkdeedu/keduvocdocument/keduvocleitnerbox
   - /trunk/KDE/kdeedu/kmplot/icons/actions

kalzium: [last checked Feb 15 02:31]
- synth merge of make_kdeedu_cool to trunk (309143 -> {309149, 309154,
  309156})
- another make_kdeedu_cool branch? called make_it_cool in commit
  messages, merged in 191127 -> 191142
- synth merge of kalziumkde4 to trunk (395799 -> 395803)
- some code was moved to libkdeedu in 470232/470255, but was then
  moved back into kalzium in 1208940. needs conversion of history.
