- for the record: r196843 adds documentation saying "moving documentation", but it doesn't actually exist anywhere else in SVN (it's not a move), so it's fine. I guess this is missing CVS history.
- should synth merge of make_kdeedu_cool to trunk (217425 -> 217432) [done-ish]

marble: [last checked Mar 1 23:28]
- synth merge of marble-geodata-nt to trunk (946595 -> 946666) [done-ish]

- there were some deletions and re-additions of the entire trunk,
  should handle sanely in git.

- check for other cases where parent-synthing is necessary

libkdeedu: [last checked Mar 10 03:12]
- convert kdeedu_parley branch [done]
- libkdeedu is mostly stuff extracted from other kdeedu apps; we
  should convert the past history from when it was in the app too.
