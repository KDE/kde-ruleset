# Created by Eike Hein <hein@kde.org>

#
# The following two additions were made to the account map file
# originally generated from KDE SVN's kde-common/accounts, as it
# didn't cover these authors:
#
#   eisfuchs Dario Abatianni <eisfuchs@tigress.com>
#   gismore Matthias Gierlings <gismore@users.sourceforge.net>
#
# With those additions, there are no more unaccounted for commit
# authors in the generated repo.
#
# The affected commits were likely from the CVS era, and the
# accounts got renamed in the CVS-to-SVN migration. Dario Aba-
# tianni's (still existing) SVN account name is "abatianni" for
# example.

# Create the KDE modules

create repository konversation

# Ignore some upheaval in KDE's SVN history.

# Konversation rules

# The following two blocks ignore an erroneous tagging of 1.2-alpha6
# and deletion of the tag. It was later tagged again correctly at SVN
# rev 1008985.

# We're not taking the 0.15 tag from /tags/konversation/0.15 as it
# produced an orphaned tag in earlier test runs (though in retro-
# spect that might have been due to the recurse rules not being
# right yet at the time either, see the next paragraph). It was ori-
# ginally at the path given below, so that works, too.
# The 0.15 tag is the only one where the entire kdeextragear-2 su-
# perstructure was tagged, rather than only the "konversation" di-
# rectory. The recurse rules further down in the ruleset are need-
# ed to deal with this situation properly.

# WARNING! The following line turned out to be an error: While it
# was meant to skip the 0.15 tag (see above), it of course also
# ended up skipping the 1.2-alpha5 tag unintentionally. It was
# later created and pushed into the repository manually instead.
