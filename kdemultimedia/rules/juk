# /branches/work/juk/ is intentionally not exported.
# It was never merged into trunk, and mpyne agreed
# with eliding it from the conversion.

# /branches/work/doc/juk/ is also ignored.
# It needs some post-processing mess to get right, and it turned out that
# the final merge of it into trunk alters screenshots too (an "evil merge").
# Having a merge commit there makes the screenshot history harder to follow.
# In general this branch is more trouble than it's worth...

# export relevant part of the bleedingedge branch
