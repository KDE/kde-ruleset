# Knights was imported to the KDE SVN with r1123248
# so svn2git can be run with --resume-from option

# Knights was only developed in playground/games and recently
# moved to kdereview, so this is rather straight-forward.

# Create the knights repository
create repository knights
end repository

# Knights from playground
match /trunk/playground/games/knights/
  repository knights
  branch master
  max revision 1177715 #without this, svn2git creates two separate histories :/
end match

# Knights from kdereview
match /trunk/kdereview/knights/
  repository knights
  branch master
end match

# Ignore the rest
match /
end match
